ðŸ§© Rubikâ€™s Cube Solver â€“ AeroHack Challenge

This project implements a beginner-friendly Rubikâ€™s Cube Solver in Java.
It models the cube using a sticker-based representation, simulates face rotations, and applies step-by-step solving algorithms (White Cross â†’ White Corners â†’ Second Layer â†’ Yellow Cross â†’ Last Layer) to reach the solved state.

âœ¨ Features

Sticker-based cube representation (Map<Character, Character[][]>)

Move Engine â€“ supports all standard moves (F, R, U, L, D, B + primes ')

Scramble Generator â€“ produces random sequences of moves to scramble the cube

Step-by-Step Solving (Beginnerâ€™s Method):

Solve White Cross (via Daisy method ðŸŒ¼)

Solve White Corners

Solve Second Layer edges

Form Yellow Cross

Position Yellow Corners

Orient Yellow Corners

Position Final Layer Edges

Cube Visualizer â€“ prints the cube net in a clear, readable format
